%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Traditional ambient noise generators, such as white, pink, or brown noise, are widely used to support relaxation, focus, or sleep. However, their effect on mental states is highly subjective and context-dependent, making the selection of appropriate noise parameters a trial-and-error process. In this work, we present the Neuro-Adaptive Noise Scape, a system that uses real-time EEG data to dynamically adjust noise characteristics according to the user’s current brain state. By analyzing EEG frequency bands (alpha, beta, theta), the system infers relaxation or focus levels and modifies the spectral and amplitude properties of the sound accordingly. Our preliminary evaluation suggests that personalized, EEG-driven noise can more effectively promote targeted mental states compared to static noise conditions. This approach demonstrates the potential of closed-loop, neuroadaptive audio environments for applications in productivity, wellness, and cognitive support, advancing the field of physiological human-computer interaction.
